#Javascript-Project

  This project is a recently popular Netflix series "Squid Game" inspired game called the "Glass Bridge". The user would be given a certain amount of avatars that he/she could use to make his/her way through the glass bridge and reach the goal line. At each length of the bridge glass there would be two pieces of glasses in front of the user, with one being the regular piece of glass that would be broken once an avatar steps on it and one being tempered glass where an avatar could step on it. Once an avatar steps on a regular peice of glass, the avatar would fall from the bridge and the broken piece of glass would remain there. The game would continue on until the player loses all the avatars.


In Squid Game, users will be able to :

  1. The kind of glass of each glass would be shown in the beginning of the game
  2. Choose which piece of glass between the two to step on for next step
  3. The glass would break and lose an avatar if stepping on a regular piece of glass
  4. If at least one avatar has reached the finish line, the game will continue, otherwise the game ends
  5. A tempered glass allows at most two avatar to step on it at the same time
  6. There would be a special character who is able to tell the difference of two kinds of glass for twice at each stage



In addition, this project will include:

  1. The game would become increasingly harder as the user gets to later stages.
  2. The user would be told of the rules of the game with instructions before it starts the game.
  3. The scores would be accumulated before the game ends. The number of avatar remaining would be the score for that specific stage.
  4. A production README

The project would be perhaps using Canvas API or other possible Javascript libraries that haven't been decided yet.


Project Timeline:

  1. Friday Afternoon & Weekend: decide the libraries and APIs and have the setup the general structure of the game, and have the user interface setup
  2. Monday: Have the whole game visualization setup
  3. Tuesday: Implement the game rules and logics 
  4. Wednesday: Implement the game rules and logics 
  5. Thursday Morning: Final testing and prepare for presentation demo
