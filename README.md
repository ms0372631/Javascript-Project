#Javascript-Project

  This project is a recently popular Netflix series "Squid Game" inspired game, or more commonly known as the "Red Light, Green Light" game, or to be more specific, it is more like a game with hybrid rules of "Red Light, Green Light" and "Hide and Seek".
  The player would start from the bottom of the gameplay and make its way to the host. The player could only move when the host turns its head back and could not see the player, while there are some trees that the player could hide behind from the host's sight. If the host sees the player while it turns its head over, the player would be killed by the laser beam that is shot from the host's eyes. The goal of the game is to get to the finish line within the time limit. There are also other factors like acceleration when the player starts to run and deceleration when the player tries to stop running. The game would be increasingly harder as users get to the later stages by having less trees or higher frequency of head spinning from the host.


In Squid Game, users will be able to :

  1. Move around the gamplay using mouse cursor, the cursor position from the player avatar would be the direction desired to move to.
  2. With the frequeny of the clicks the user attemps being the accerlation of the moving avatar.
  3. Hide behind the obstacles so that the host would not be able to see any movements from the user.
  4. The host would not attack the user if the user is stationary within the host's sight.
  5. Move to the finishline would win the stage.


In addition, this project will include:

  1. The game would become increasingly harder as the user gets to later stages.
  2. The user would be told of the rules of the game with instructions before it starts the game.
  3. The scores would be accumulated before the game ends. The time remaining would be the score for that specific stage.
  4. A production README
